# NYC Airbnb Market Analysis
## Project Source

This project was completed as part of the Analyzing NYC Airbnb Market on DataCamp. The course provided the dataset and guided instructions for performing the analysis. I have implemented the techniques and skills learned from the course to conduct this analysis and present the findings.

## Overview

New York City, one of the most vibrant cities in the world, experiences a high demand for temporary lodging, resulting in a thriving Airbnb market. This project aims to explore the NYC Airbnb market by combining data from various file formats such as CSV, TSV, and Excel, answering key questions about pricing, room types, and reviews. The analysis is based on data obtained from the DataCamp platform.

## Achievements and Skills

- **Data Integration**: Successfully merged data from different file types (CSV, TSV, Excel) for comprehensive analysis.
- **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: Processed raw data to convert it into a suitable format for analysis, ensuring accuracy in calculations.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Utilized Python libraries to calculate and interpret summary statistics for pricing information.
- **Data Visualization**: Effectively visualized insights to facilitate clear communication of findings.

## Context and Motivation

The motivation behind this project was to practice and showcase my data analysis skills while exploring an intriguing aspect of the hospitality industry in one of the world's most visited cities. By working on this project, I aimed to:

- Gain hands-on experience in data integration and cleaning.
- Explore trends and patterns in Airbnb pricing and room types.
- Understand how the NYC Airbnb market compares to the private rental market.

## Project Description

### Data

The project utilized three datasets containing information on Airbnb listings in NYC, including details on pricing, room types, and reviews.

### Data Cleaning and Analysis

The initial phase involved importing and cleaning the data to prepare it for analysis. Notably, the pricing column required significant cleaning, as it initially included currency symbols and whitespace. The data was then used to calculate average prices and compare them to the private rental market.

### Room Type Analysis

The project also examined the distribution of room types available on Airbnb, identifying variations in the prevalence of private rooms, shared spaces, and entire homes/apartments.

### Borough-wise Pricing

The analysis further segmented pricing data by NYC boroughs to understand how listing prices varied across different areas of the city.

## Conclusion

The NYC Airbnb Analysis project uncovers a wealth of insights into the dynamic Airbnb market in New York City. The comprehensive data analysis, encompassing pricing trends, room types, and borough-wise pricing differentials, provides valuable intelligence for both potential guests and hosts.

Notably, the findings reveal a nuanced pricing landscape, with significant variations across boroughs. This knowledge empowers both hosts seeking to competitively price their listings and guests looking for suitable accommodations within their budget.

Furthermore, the project underscores the enduring appeal of Airbnb in the hospitality industry, showcasing its ability to cater to a diverse range of travelers, from those seeking shared spaces to those in search of exclusive, private accommodations.

In conclusion, this analysis not only illuminates the NYC Airbnb market but also serves as a testament to the enduring relevance and adaptability of the platform in meeting the diverse needs of both hosts and guests in one of the world's most dynamic cities.


## Portfolio Reflection

This project showcases my ability to integrate and clean diverse datasets, perform in-depth analysis, and communicate findings effectively. It highlights my proficiency in Python programming and data analysis techniques, as well as my capacity to derive meaningful insights from real-world datasets.
